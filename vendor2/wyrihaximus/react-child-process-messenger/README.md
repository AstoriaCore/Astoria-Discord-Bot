Plain messages and RPC style STDIN/OUT/ERR wrapper around [`react/child-process`](https://github.com/reactphp/child-process). For pooling messengers take a look at [`wyrihaximus/react-child-process-pool`](https://github.com/WyriHaximus/reactphp-child-process-pool)

### Installation ###

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `~`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/react-child-process-messenger 
```

## Hassle less Example ##

While this package supports several ways of setting up communication between parent and child the simplest way is to create class implementing `WyriHaximus\React\ChildProcess\Messenger\ChildInterface`. Up on calling `create` everything is set up and created to handle supported `RPC`'s and messages. 

```php
<?php

use React\EventLoop\LoopInterface;
use WyriHaximus\React\ChildProcess\Messenger\ChildInterface;
use WyriHaximus\React\ChildProcess\Messenger\Messages\Payload;

class ExampleChild implements ChildInterface
{
    public static function create(Messenger $messenger, LoopInterface $loop)
    {
        $messenger->registerRpc('example', function (Payload $payload) {
            return \React\Promise\resolve($payload->getPayload());
        });
    }
}
```

On the parent side you only need need to call to spawn a child running that class:

```php
MessengerFactory::parentFromClass('ExampleChild', $loop)->then(function (Messenger $messenger) {
    $messenger->rpc(/* etc etc */);
});
```

## More Examples ##
